# Hi there, I'm Sajib ü§ù


I'm an Internet of Things (IoT) student at the [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]], passionate about [[software]], [[robotics]], and [[AI]].

- **Currently**, I'm working on a robotics project at the [[University of Eastern Finland]].
- I interned at [[Holobiont Oy]] during the summer of 2023.
- I interned at [[Savonia-ammattikorkeakoulu Oy]] during the spring of 2023.
- I continuously engage in [[projects]] throughout the semester to enhance my problem-solving skills alongside my theoretical studies.


## My Playing Devices üìõ
I frequently work with my ``personal kits/devices`` such as the [[NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano]], [[ Raspberry Pi 3 B]], [[Raspberry Pi 4 B]], [[Raspberry Pi 5]], and [[Galaxy RVR Robot]].
