> [!done] Internship 2A
> I completed my second internship, both [[Internship]] 2A and [[Internship]] 2B, at [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]], officially known as [[Savonia-ammattikorkeakoulu Oy]].

I started working in January 2023 until March 2023, focus of my internship was on `Siemens Mindsphere water process cloud data analysis and digita[](Siemens%20Mindsphere%20water%20process%20cloud%20data%20analysis%20and%20digital%20twin%20development.md)r was [Arto Toppinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arto-toppinen-88574a10/?originalSubdomain=fi), and the internship fell under a project named **Virtual Learning Environment Smart Factory [(VLEFACTORY)](https://vlefactory.eu/mu1-siemens-mindsphere-water-process-data-analysis)**. I spent three months working with the **Water Process Lab** at [[Siemens Mindsphere water process cloud data analysis and digital twin development]]. In March, I presented the final results of the project in **Germany** at [Carl-Benz-Schule Gaggenau](https://www.carl-benz-schule-gaggenau.de/).

Here is a brief overview of what I implemented during my internship.
