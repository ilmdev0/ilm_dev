I took the entrance exams for five different universities in early 2021:

1. Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK)
2. Jyväskylä University of Applied Sciences
3. Savonia University of Applied Sciences
4. South-Eastern Finland University of Applied Sciences
5. Karelia University of Applied Sciences

I decided to accept [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]] (Microkatu, Kuopio Campus) for a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, specializing in the Internet of Things (IoT). I deferred my enrolment for one year and began my semester in July 2022.

Some key courses I have completed so far include:

- Basics of Programming | C
- User Interface Programming | C#
- Browser Programming | HTML, CSS, Java
- Circuit and Systems
- Digital Electronics
- Sensor Basics
- Data Structures and Algorithms | Java

I am expect to complete my degree by the end of 2025, provide I finish my thesis within this time frame.
