I took the entrance exams for four different universities in early 2021 and I got 4 admission letter.

1. Tampere University of Applied Sciences (TAMK)

I decided to accept [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]] (Microkatu, Kuopio Campus) for a Bachelor of Engineering in Information Technology, specializing in the Internet of Things (IoT). I deferred my enrolment for one year and began my semester in July 2022.
