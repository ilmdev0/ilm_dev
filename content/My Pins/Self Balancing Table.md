# Self Balancing Table


# Problem
During the summer, as we engage in outdoor activities such as parties, sunbathing, and hiking, we often face the challenge of finding a stable surface for our food, coffee cups, and water glasses. Outdoor terrains are typically uneven, making it difficult to place a regular table without compromising its level surface. This issue persists during winter activities in snowy conditions, where placing a conventional table becomes impractical due to the risk of the legs getting stuck.

# Solution and Benefits of the Self-Balancing Table:
Our solution addresses these challenges by introducing a self-balancing table that can adapt to any uneven surface. The table automatically stabilizes itself, ensuring a level surface regardless of the field's irregularities. When transporting the table from one location to another, built-in sensors detect changes in the surface and adjust the height of the table legs accordingly, maintaining stability.


# Components Used:

- Arduino UNO
- XYZ Accelerometer Sensor
- 360-Degree Rotation Servo Motor
- Voltage Divider
- 3D Printed Parts
