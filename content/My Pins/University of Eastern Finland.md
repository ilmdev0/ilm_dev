**Since October 2023, I've been employed** at the [[University of Eastern Finland]] as a **Software Developer Trainee**, focusing on the project [Acquisition of mobile robots and 5G technology suitable for operating room environments](https://uefconnect.uef.fi/tutkimusryhma/leikkaussaliymparistoon-soveltuvien-mobiilirobottien-ja-5g-teknologian-hankinta/) at [HUMEA Lab](https://sites.uef.fi/humea/humea-laboratory/). My tenure lasted until December 31st, 2023. Throughout this period, I engaged with a variety of devices:

1. [[Ceterio C-100 Mobile Robot]]
2. [[Ouster LiDAR model OS0]]
3. [[Robosense bpearl LiDAR]]
4. [[Depth Camera D435 - Intel RealSense]]
5. [[Depth Camera D455i - Intel RealSense]]
6. [[Sick 2D Lidar]]

Within the project, I implemented the Gazebo model of the HUMEA Lab and operated the virtual Autonomous Mobile robot, leveraging SLAM and Navigation stack, I enabled autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and map generation.

Moreover, the [[Ceterio C-100 Mobile Robot ]]offers Docker functionality, wherein each device runs in a separate container. This aspect was particularly intriguing to me as I'm well-versed in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), both in [rootless](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) and [root mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) configurations.


Currently, I am working on another project called  **Development of online robot software environment**.
