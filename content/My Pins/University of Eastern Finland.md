Since October 2023, I've been employed at the University of Eastern Finland as a Software Developer Trainee, focusing on the project ``Acquisition of mobile robots and 5G technology suitable for operating room environments``. My tenure lasted until December 31st, 2023. Throughout this period, I engaged with a variety of devices:

1. Ceterio C-100 Mobile Robot
2. Ouster LiDAR model OS0
3. Robosense bpearl LiDAR
4. Depth Camera D435 - Intel RealSense
5. Depth Camera D455i - Intel RealSense
6. Sick 2D Lidar

Within the project, I implemented the Gazebo model of the HUMEA Lab and operated the virtual Autonomous Mobile robot. Leveraging SLAM and Navigation stack, I enabled autonomous navigation, obstacle avoidance, and map generation.

Moreover, the ``Ceterio C-100 Mobile Robot`` offers Docker functionality, wherein each device runs in a separate container. This aspect was particularly intriguing to me as I'm well-versed in Docker, both in rootless and root mode configurations.
