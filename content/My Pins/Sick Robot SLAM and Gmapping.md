# Two wheel Simple Robot SLAM and Gmapping


![[robot_view.png]]

  
  
This project demonstrates how to implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping) using the Gmapping algorithm on a two-wheel robot with two caster wheels.

## Overview

  

This repository contains the necessary code and instructions to build and run a two-wheel robot equipped, and Sick 2D LiDAR with SLAM capabilities using the Gmapping algorithm. The robot uses two main wheels for movement and two caster wheels for balance.

  

## Features

  

- Implementation of SLAM using the Gmapping algorithm.

- mapping capabilities.

- Real-time visualization using RViz.

  

## Requirements

  

- ROS (Robot Operating System) Noetic

- Catkin workspace

- Ubuntu 20.04

  

## Installation

  

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

  

```
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src

cd catkin_ws/src

git clone https://github.com/SAJIB3489/sick_robot.git

cd ~/catkin_ws

rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y

source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash

source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

catkin_make
```

  
  

### Step 2: Launch

  

**Launch gazebo simulation**

```
roslaunch sick_robot_description gazebo.launch
```

  
  

**Launch RViz** Open a new Terminal.

```
roslaunch sick_robot_description display.launch
```

  

**Start Gmapping** Open a new Terminal.

```
roslaunch sick_robot_description mapping.launch
```

  

**Drive the robot using keyboard** Open a new Terminal.

```
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

If you do not have the package install it using ``sudo apt-get install ros-$ROS_DISTRO-teleop-twist-keyboard``

**To save the map**

```
rosrun map_server map_saver -f robot_map
```
