I completed two internships at [[Savonia-ammattikorkeakoulu Oy]] under the supervision of [Arto Toppinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arto-toppinen-88574a10/?originalSubdomain=fi), a Principal Lecturer at [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]]. It was an excellent journey working under his guidance.

During my time there, I learned a great deal about the Savonia Water Process Machine and the Savonia Mini Smart Factory.

Here are the two topics I worked on:

1. **Water Process Machine:** [[Siemens Mindsphere water process cloud data analysis and digital twin development]].
2. **Smart Factory:** [[Smart Factory cloud data analysis and develop the Augmented Reality(AR)]].
