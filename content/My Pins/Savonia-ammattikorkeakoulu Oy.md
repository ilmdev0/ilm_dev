> [!done] Internship 2A
> I completed my second internship, both [[Internship 2A]] and [[Internship 2B]], at [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]], officially known as [[Savonia-ammattikorkeakoulu Oy]].

I started working in January 2023 and concluded on March 31, 2023. The focus of my internship was on `Siemens Mindsphere water process cloud data analysis and digital twin development`. My supervisor was [Arto Toppinen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arto-toppinen-88574a10/?originalSubdomain=fi), and the internship fell under a project named **Virtual Learning Environment Smart Factory [(VLEFACTORY)](https://vlefactory.eu/mu1-siemens-mindsphere-water-process-data-analysis)**. I spent three months working with the **Water Process Lab** at [[Savonia-ammattikorkeakoulu Oy]]. In March, I presented the final results of the project in **Germany** at [Carl-Benz-Schule Gaggenau](https://www.carl-benz-schule-gaggenau.de/).

Here is a brief overview of what I implemented during my internship.

## Introduction to Water Level Process


The Water Level Process machine plays a crucial role in numerous industrial and infrastructure systems where the monitoring and control of water levels are vital. It is an essential component in various applications such as water treatment plants, reservoirs, irrigation systems, and flood control mechanisms. The accurate measurement and control of water levels are critical for ensuring optimal operation, preventing overflows or shortages, and maintaining overall system stability.

The Water Level Process machine operates by continuously monitoring the water level in a designated area or container and employing control mechanisms to regulate and maintain the desired water level. This process involves the integration of sensors, actuators, and control systems to achieve precise and automated control of water levels. Figure 1 shows water process machine.
