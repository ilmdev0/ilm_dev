>[!done] Java
>During my fourth semester at [[Savonia University of Applied Sciences]], I took a course on Data Structures and Algorithms. During this time, I learned Java programming and engaged in various class exercises, problem-solving tasks, and additional assignments. Here are the topics I covered:

  

## The Following Topics Covered
  

1. Introduction Task (Basics)

2. Efficiency Analysis

3. Sorting

4. Lists

5. Hash Table

6. Binary Search Tree

7. Heap

8. Backtracking

  

## Getting Started

  

To get started with this repository, follow the instructions below based on your operating system.

  

### Prerequisites

  

- Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed. You can download it from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

- Install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/), a popular Java IDE.

  

### Cloning the Repository

  

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

  

```
<font color="#c0504d">git clone</font> https://github.com/SAJIB3489/problem_solving-Java.git

cd problem_solving-Java
```

  
  

## Debugging with IntelliJ IDEA

  

#### Windows Users

  

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA:**

Launch IntelliJ IDEA from your Start Menu or Desktop shortcut.

  

2. **Import the Project:**

Go to File -> Open... and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

Select the project folder and click OK.

  

3. **Configure JDK:**

IntelliJ might prompt you to configure the JDK if it's not already set. Point to the JDK installation path (e.g., ``C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17``).

  

4. **Build the Project:**

Go to Build -> Build Project to compile the code.

  

5. **Run/Debug a Program:**

Open the Java file you want to debug.

Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin of the code editor.

Right-click inside the editor and select Debug <ClassName>.

IntelliJ will start the debugger, and execution will pause at the breakpoints you set. You can then step through the code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.

  
  

## Linux Users

  

1. **Open IntelliJ IDEA:**

Launch IntelliJ IDEA from your Applications menu or via terminal by typing intellij-idea-ultimate (or intellij-idea-community if you have the community edition).

  

2. **Import the Project:**

Go to File -> Open... and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

Select the project folder and click OK.

  

3. **Configure JDK:**

IntelliJ might prompt you to configure the JDK if it's not already set. Point to the JDK installation path (e.g.,`` /usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk``).

  

4. **Build the Project:**

Go to Build -> Build Project to compile the code.

  

5. **Run/Debug a Program:**

Open the Java file you want to debug.

Set breakpoints by clicking on the left margin of the code editor.

Right-click inside the editor and select Debug <ClassName>.

IntelliJ will start the debugger, and execution will pause at the breakpoints you set. You can then step through the code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.
